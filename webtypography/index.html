			<h1>The Pizza that Hates Itself</h1>

		<blockquote>
			<h2>"No to drugs, yes to pizza."</h2>
		</blockquote>

	<p class="col-4">
		That's the slogan stamped on the pizza box at Ugi's, Buenos Aires's legendary pizza chain famous for its budget pizza and cult following. Pizzerias line just about every block of Argentina's pizza-loving capital, a country where more than 60 percent of the population is of Italian descent, but no other pizza shop has made a name for itself quite like Ugi's. Since it opened in 1980, Ugi's Pizza became a hit for its central locations, bare-bones ambiance, and affordable pizzas.
