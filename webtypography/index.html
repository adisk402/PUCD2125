		That's the slogan stamped on the pizza box at Ugi's, Buenos Aires's legendary pizza chain famous for its budget pizza and cult following. Pizzerias line just about every block of Argentina's pizza-loving capital, a country where more than 60 percent of the population is of Italian descent, but no other pizza shop has made a name for itself quite like Ugi's. Since it opened in 1980, Ugi's Pizza became a hit for its central locations, bare-bones ambiance, and affordable pizzas.

		To explain Ugi's furor on social media, it's first important to understand the brand and its history. "Ugi's plays a role in our popular culture; it's part of Buenos Aires's urban landscape," says Luciano Banchero, a local radio personality and pizza expert. Ugi's was the first chain to bring fast food pizza to the Argentinian masses, appealing to students and the working class. The original owner, Hugo Sol√≠s Sr. ("Ugi" is a nickname for Hugo), was inspired after living and working in the United States, and brought back to Argentina what was then a marvel concept: to choose one simple, low-cost item and serve it at an economical price in a no-frills setting.
